Common Exercises
================

This unit focuses on common exercises for each major body part, categorizing them into cardio, strength, and stretching, to provide a comprehensive understanding for gym beginners.

1\. Prerequisites
-----------------

To fully understand this module, it is recommended to have prior knowledge of:

2\. Importance of Today's Learning
----------------------------------

This session is crucial for beginners in a gym setting. It aims to help understand how common exercises can be performed correctly, ensuring effectiveness and minimizing the risk of injury. The goal is to provide a solid foundation before moving to more advanced modules.

3\. Overview of Exercise Categories
-----------------------------------

Exercises are broadly categorized based on their primary function and the type of fitness they enhance.

### a. Cardio Exercises

Cardio or cardiorespiratory exercises primarily focus on improving heart health. These activities make the heart more efficient at pumping blood, leading to improved oxygen delivery and cardiovascular endurance. They are crucial for improving overall health.

*   **Examples:** Running, walking, cycling, dancing, swimming, rowing, boxing, elliptical trainer, treadmill.
    
*   **Benefits:** Can be done anywhere, anytime, with minimal equipment.
    
*   **Important Note:** The primary goal of cardio workouts is to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, not necessarily fat loss. It's easy to overestimate calories burned during cardio sessions.
    

### b. Strength Training Exercises

Strength training (also known as resistance training) focuses on improving muscular strength, power, and endurance by working muscles against resistance.

*   **Emphasis for Beginners:** For beginners, the focus should be on mastering correct form and technique, even with lighter weights, to build a strong foundation and prevent injuries.
    

### c. Stretching Exercises

Stretching exercises focus on improving flexibility, which is the range of motion around a joint.

*   **Benefits:** Improves joint mobility, reduces muscle stiffness, and can indirectly enhance performance in strength and cardio exercises by allowing a fuller range of motion.
    
*   **Examples:** Yoga, Tai Chi, Pilates, foam rolling.
    

4\. Body Part Specific Exercises
--------------------------------

Here's a breakdown of common exercises targeting major muscle groups.

### a. Chest Exercises

Chest muscles (pectorals) are located on the front of the chest and are responsible for movements like pushing and bringing the arms across the body.

*   **Examples:** Push-ups (various forms: wall, incline, knee, regular) , Dumbbell press (flat, incline, decline) , Barbell press (flat, incline, decline) , Dumbbell fly (flat, incline, decline) , Cable crossover/Cable fly , Pec deck fly machine.
    

### b. Shoulder Exercises

Shoulder muscles (deltoids) give the shoulder its rounded shape and are involved in various arm movements. They have anterior (front), lateral (side), and posterior (rear) heads.

*   **Examples:** Overhead press (dumbbell/barbell) , Lateral raises (dumbbell/cable) , Front raises (dumbbell/cable) , Rear delt fly (dumbbell/pec deck machine) , Upright rows.
    

### c. Back Exercises

Back muscles include the latissimus dorsi (lats) and trapezius (traps), among others, and are crucial for pulling movements, posture, and spinal stability.

*   **Examples:** Pull-ups , Lat pulldowns (machine/resistance band) , Rows (dumbbell/barbell/cable/machine) , Deadlifts (various forms) , Shrugs.
    

### d. Arm Exercises

Arm muscles include biceps (front of upper arm) and triceps (back of upper arm).

*   **Biceps Exercises:** Biceps are responsible for elbow flexion.
    
    *   **Examples:** Bicep curls (dumbbell/barbell/cable/machine, preacher curls).
        
*   **Triceps Exercises:** Triceps are responsible for elbow extension.
    
    *   **Examples:** Tricep extensions (overhead dumbbell/cable/machine, skullcrushers) , Close-grip push-ups , Dips (bench/parallel bars).
        

### e. Abdominal (Core) Exercises

Abdominal muscles (abs) stabilize the trunk and enable various trunk movements.

*   **Examples:** Crunches , Planks (various variations) , Leg raises , Russian twists , Mountain climbers.
    

### f. Leg Exercises

Leg muscles include quadriceps (front thigh), hamstrings (rear thigh), and glutes (buttocks).

*   **Quadriceps Exercises:** Quads are responsible for knee extension.
    
    *   **Examples:** Squats (bodyweight, goblet, barbell) , Lunges (front, reverse, walking) , Leg press (machine) , Leg extension (machine).
        
*   **Hamstring Exercises:** Hamstrings are responsible for knee flexion and hip extension.
    
    *   **Examples:** Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs) , Leg curls (lying/seated machine) , Glute-ham raises , Good mornings.
        
*   **Glute Exercises:** Glutes are involved in hip extension and abduction.
    
    *   **Examples:** Hip thrusts , Glute bridges , Cable pull-throughs , Kickbacks.
        

### g. Calf Exercises

Calf muscles are located at the back of the lower leg and are responsible for ankle plantarflexion (pointing toes).

*   **Examples:** Calf raises (standing/seated, machine/dumbbell).
