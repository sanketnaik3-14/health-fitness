Types of Exercise
=================

This unit explores the skill-based components of fitness, and how to estimate calories burned during various exercises, providing a practical understanding for prescribing exercises and analyzing client activity.

1\. Recap of Health-Related Fitness Components
----------------------------------------------

As a quick review from a previous session, health-related fitness components include:

*   **Cardiovascular Endurance:** The heart's ability to efficiently pump blood during high-intensity exercises, leading to an increased heart rate. Activities include cycling, running, and jumping.
    
*   **Muscular Endurance:** The ability of muscles to contract continuously against resistance. Examples include doing many push-ups or performing "as many reps as possible" (AMRAP) in exercises like squats or lunges.
    
*   **Muscular Strength:** The maximum force a person can apply in a single effort or attempt.
    
*   **Flexibility:** The range of motion an individual can achieve at a particular joint.
    
*   **Body Composition:** The ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass in the body.
    

2\. Skill-Related Fitness Components
------------------------------------

These components are crucial for athletic performance and specialized movements:

*   **Power:** The ability to exert maximum muscle contraction instantly in an explosive burst of movement. It combines strength and speed.
    
    *   **Examples:** Olympic weightlifting (snatch, clean & jerk), track and field (e.g., 100-meter sprint), and boxing (powerful, quick punches).
        
*   **Balance:** The ability to control one's body position, whether stationary or moving.
    
    *   **Examples:** Surfing (moving balance), yoga's tree pose (stationary balance), horse riding (equestrian sports like polo), and gymnastics.
        
*   **Speed:** The ability to move all parts of the body as quickly as possible.
    
    *   **Examples:** Track and field (sprints), speed skating, swimming, and running.
        
*   **Agility:** The ability of a person to perform a series of powerful movements in rapid succession in opposite directions.
    
    *   **Examples:** Badminton (quick movements across the court), soccer (dodging with quick footwork), and tennis.
        
*   **Reaction Time:** How quickly one can respond to a sensory stimulus (hearing, seeing, or feeling).
    
    *   **Examples:** Martial arts, boxing (dodging punches), and motor sports (making quick decisions on the racetrack).
        
*   **Coordination:** The ability of a person to have all the skills (power, agility, speed, balance) to achieve a good hand-eye or foot-eye coordination.
    
    *   **Examples:** Cricket (combining power, agility, speed, balance, and reaction time for batting and running between wickets), hockey, and basketball.
        

**Important Note:** Most sports involve more than one skill-related fitness component. To excel in a sport, individuals often need to develop multiple skills, with certain skills dominating over others depending on the specific activity (e.g., balance is paramount in equestrian sports like polo, even though power is also involved).

3\. Estimating Calories Burned from Exercise
--------------------------------------------

While tracking calories consumed is generally more accurate for fat loss goals, it's possible to estimate calories burned during exercise.

*   **Metabolic Equivalent (MET) Values:**
    
    *   Scientists use MET values (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) to quantify the energy expenditure of various activities.
        
    *   One MET is defined as the metabolic rate at rest, where approximately 3.5 milliliters of oxygen are consumed per kilogram of body weight per minute.
        
    *   Higher MET values indicate higher intensity and calorie expenditure.
        
    *   These values are often derived from laboratory settings, typically based on a 70 kg individual, and thus represent approximations rather than exact figures.
        
*   **Formula for Energy Burned Per Minute:**
    
    *   Calories burned per minute = (MET value × 3.5 × Body Weight in kg) / 200
        
    *   **Example:** For an 80 kg person doing circuit training (MET value of 8):
        
        *   (8 × 3.5 × 80) / 200 = 11.2 calories per minute.
            
        *   If performed for one hour (60 minutes), the estimated burn is 11.2 calories/minute \* 60 minutes = 672 calories.
            
*   **Limitations and Practical Considerations:**
    
    *   **Approximation:** The calculated calories burned are approximate. Real-world factors like environment (air conditioning, outdoor conditions), rest periods, and individual variations influence actual energy expenditure.
        
    *   **Activity Duration vs. Actual Work:** Smartwatches and fitness trackers use similar MET-based formulas, often asking for personal details like body weight. However, they continuously track "workout time" even during warm-ups, rest periods, or casual conversation at the gym, which can inflate the reported calorie burn compared to actual active work.
        
    *   **Focus on Intake:** For weight management goals (fat loss or muscle gain), it is generally more accurate and reliable to focus on calculating and tracking _calories taken in_ rather than trying to precisely measure _calories burned out_ from exercise.

3\. Importance of Fitness
-------------------------

Fitness plays a vital role not only in sports but also in managing daily activities and overall health.

### Health-Related Benefits:

*   Fights against obesity.
    
*   Helps prevent and manage lifestyle disorders such as thyroid issues, PCOS, diabetes, and insulin resistance.
    
*   Promotes better sleep.
    
*   Improves mood by inducing the release of "feel-good hormones" (endorphins) after exercise, leading to a sense of happiness and satisfaction.
    
*   Working on health-related components directly contributes to improving one's health.
    

### Skill-Related Benefits:

*   Working on skill-related components (e.g., power, agility) enhances performance in specific sports activities.
    
*   Different goals require focusing on different fitness components; health goals require attention to health-related components, while sports performance goals require focus on skill-related components.
    

4\. Detailed Look at Health-Related Fitness Components & Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Cardiovascular Endurance

*   **Definition:** The ability to perform repetitive, moderate to high-intensity movements for a long period. This involves increasing heart rate considerably.
    
*   **Examples of Exercises:** Walking, running, dancing, cycling, skipping, or any activity that significantly elevates the heart rate for a sustained duration.
    
*   **Basic Fitness Test: 12-Minute Run Test (Cooper Test):**
    
    *   **Procedure:** Ask the client to run as far as possible for 12 minutes.
        
    *   **Calculation:** Use the distance covered in 12 minutes to estimate VO2 max (maximum oxygen utilization during maximal effort). The formula is: VO2 max = (22.351 × kilometers covered in 12 minutes) - 11.28.
        
    *   **Interpretation:** Compare the calculated VO2 max to age-specific charts. For example, a 35-year-old male running 2 km in 12 minutes would have a VO2 max of approximately 33.422. This value can indicate their cardiovascular risk level (e.g., falling into a "middle range" or "low risk" zone).
        
    *   **Application:** These tests should not be used to scare clients, but rather to assess their current fitness and motivate them to improve their cardiovascular endurance through training.
        

### Muscular Endurance

*   **Definition:** The ability of muscles to perform a continuous movement against a given resistance for an extended period.
    
*   **Examples of Exercises:** Walking lunges, planks, push-ups, bodyweight squats, chin-ups, and other calisthenic movements.
    
*   **Basic Fitness Test: As Many Reps As Possible (AMRAP):**
    
    *   **Procedure:** Ask a person to perform an exercise (e.g., push-ups) continuously until their body gives up.
        
    *   **Assessment:** The number of repetitions completed (e.g., 50 push-ups versus 20 push-ups) indicates their muscular endurance.
        
    *   **Improvement:** Muscular endurance improves with consistent practice and increasing repetitions over time.
        

### Muscular Strength

*   **Definition:** The maximum force muscles can exert in a single, maximal effort. It measures how "strong" an individual is.
    
*   **Examples of Exercises:** Squats, deadlifts, and bench press (major compound lifts in weight training).
    
*   **Basic Fitness Test: One-Rep Maximum (1RM) Test:**
    
    *   **Procedure:** Ask the person to lift the maximum amount of weight possible for one single repetition in exercises like deadlift, squat, bench press, or overhead press.
        
    *   **Assessment:** The weight successfully lifted for one repetition indicates their 1RM. For example, if a person can deadlift 100 kg for one rep but no more, their 1RM is 100 kg.
        
    *   **Alternative Tests:** Instead of 1RM, you can also use 5-rep max or 10-rep max tests to assess strength progression. For instance, if a person lifts 20 kg for 5 reps, and later 50 kg for 5 reps, their strength has improved.
        
    *   **Caution:** Frequent 1RM testing is not advisable due to the risk of injury if form is compromised.
        

### Flexibility

*   **Definition:** The capacity of joints or a group of joints to move freely through their entire range of motion without discomfort. For example, a shoulder joint can move 360 degrees.
    
*   **Examples of Exercises:** Yoga, Tai Chi, foam rolling, and Pilates help improve flexibility by increasing range of motion and reducing muscle stiffness.
    
*   **Basic Fitness Test: Sit and Reach Test:**
    
    *   **Procedure:** Remove shoes. Sit on a flat surface with legs extended. Place feet against a stable surface (e.g., a staircase step). Place a ruler on top of the step with the zero mark facing you. Without bending knees, bend forward and reach as far as possible on the ruler, holding the position for a few seconds.
        
    *   **Assessment:** The furthest point reached on the ruler indicates flexibility. For example, reaching +15 cm would be in the "good" range (11-20 cm). If unable to reach the zero mark, flexibility is poor.
        
    *   **Indirect Impact:** While flexibility exercises may not directly burn many calories for body composition improvement, they indirectly help by improving strength training, cardiovascular training, and muscular endurance through enhanced range of motion.
        

### Body Composition

*   **Definition:** The ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass (muscles, bones, organs, blood). An ideal body composition has more fat-free mass.
    
*   **Improvement:** Working on strength training, cardiovascular endurance, and muscular endurance, along with proper nutrition, helps improve body composition by increasing muscle mass and reducing fat percentage.
    
*   **Basic Fitness Test: Fat Calipers:**
    
    *   **Procedure:** Use fat calipers to pinch skinfold thickness at specific sites (e.g., triceps, biceps, shoulder blade, waist).
        
    *   **Calculation:** Average the measurements from these sites and compare to a chart based on age and gender to find the approximate body fat percentage.
        
    *   **Assessment:** This indicates whether one has a good body composition or needs to work on reducing fat percentage.
