### Micronutrients

This unit covers the definition, types, functions, sources, and deficiencies of micronutrients, specifically vitamins and minerals.

#### 1\. What are Micronutrients?

*   Definition: "Micro" means small quantity. Micronutrients are essential nutrients required by the body in smaller quantities.
    
*   Overall Role: Despite being needed in small amounts, they play crucial roles in ensuring the smooth functioning of various bodily processes.
    
*   Classification: Micronutrients are further classified into vitamins and minerals.
    

#### 2\. Vitamins

*   *   *   Solubility: These vitamins are soluble in fat and not in water (hydrophobic).
            
        *   Absorption and Storage: They require some amount of fat for absorption and storage in the body.
            
        *   Toxicity Risk: Deficiency is rare, but if taken in large quantities, they can be toxic because they cannot be easily eliminated from the body via urine.
            
        *   Functions and Sources:
            
            *   Vitamin A:
                
                *   Sources: Meat, fish, liver, yellow/orange fruits and vegetables (carrots, pumpkins, papaya, mangoes), and leafy vegetables.
                    
                *   Function: Responsible for growth and vision.
                    
                *   Deficiency: Can lead to impaired vision, including night blindness (nyctalopia).
                    
            *   Vitamin D:

    *   *   Solubility: These vitamins dissolve in water (hydrophilic) and require water for absorption, transport, and storage.
            
        *   Toxicity Risk: Deficiency is common, but excess intake usually does not cause toxicity because they can be easily excreted via urine.
            
        *   Types of B Vitamins: B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B7 (biotin), B9 (folic acid), and B12 (cobalamin). (Note: There is no B4 or B8 in the complex).
            
        *   Functions:
            
            *   Vitamin B Complex: Assists in carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism (breaking them down for energy), synthesis of red blood cells (RBCs), good hair and nail health, cellular growth, and wound healing.
                
            *   Vitamin C: Required for wound healing, immune system function, and collagen synthesis (collagen holds cells together and is present in bones and other body structures).
                
*   Addressing Vitamin Deficiencies:
    
    *   Prevention: Best prevented by consuming a variety of whole foods, including different fruits and vegetables, which are rich in micronutrients.
        
    *   Treatment: If a deficiency is suspected, a physician should analyze and evaluate it before recommending supplementation.
        
    *   Multivitamin Supplements: Can help subside symptoms, but safety should always be confirmed by a physician before consumption, especially for fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), which can be toxic in large doses.
        

#### 3\. Minerals

#### 4\. Summary of Micronutrients

*   Two Types: Micronutrients are either vitamins (organic) or minerals (inorganic).
    
*   Overall Role: Together, vitamins and minerals work in many ways to balance health and ensure optimal body functioning.
    
*   Fat-Soluble Vitamins (A, D, E, K): Required for functions like good vision, bone health, antioxidant action, and blood clotting. They are absorbed and transported with fats and can cause toxicity if consumed in excess.
    
*   Water-Soluble Vitamins (B Complex, C): Dissolve in water and are generally not toxic in large quantities as excess is excreted via urine. They play roles in metabolism, tissue synthesis, DNA production, hair/nail health, blood recovery, and more.
    
*   Minerals: Classified as bulk (macro) or trace (micro) based on required quantity. They are essential for functions like bone health, maintaining body pH (acid-base balance), blood health, and nutrient transport.
