Types of Exercise
=================

This unit explores the skill-based components of fitness, and how to estimate calories burned during various exercises, providing a practical understanding for prescribing exercises and analyzing client activity.

1\. Recap of Health-Related Fitness Components
----------------------------------------------

As a quick review from a previous session, health-related fitness components include:

*   **Cardiovascular Endurance:** The heart's ability to efficiently pump blood during high-intensity exercises, leading to an increased heart rate. Activities include cycling, running, and jumping.
    
*   **Muscular Endurance:** The ability of muscles to contract continuously against resistance. Examples include doing many push-ups or performing "as many reps as possible" (AMRAP) in exercises like squats or lunges.
    
*   **Muscular Strength:** The maximum force a person can apply in a single effort or attempt.
    
*   **Flexibility:** The range of motion an individual can achieve at a particular joint.
    
*   **Body Composition:** The ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass in the body.
    

2\. Skill-Related Fitness Components
------------------------------------

These components are crucial for athletic performance and specialized movements:

*   **Power:** The ability to exert maximum muscle contraction instantly in an explosive burst of movement. It combines strength and speed.
    
    *   **Examples:** Olympic weightlifting (snatch, clean & jerk), track and field (e.g., 100-meter sprint), and boxing (powerful, quick punches).
        
*   **Balance:** The ability to control one's body position, whether stationary or moving.
    
    *   **Examples:** Surfing (moving balance), yoga's tree pose (stationary balance), horse riding (equestrian sports like polo), and gymnastics.
        
*   **Speed:** The ability to move all parts of the body as quickly as possible.
    
    *   **Examples:** Track and field (sprints), speed skating, swimming, and running.
        
*   **Agility:** The ability of a person to perform a series of powerful movements in rapid succession in opposite directions.
    
    *   **Examples:** Badminton (quick movements across the court), soccer (dodging with quick footwork), and tennis.
        
*   **Reaction Time:** How quickly one can respond to a sensory stimulus (hearing, seeing, or feeling).
    
    *   **Examples:** Martial arts, boxing (dodging punches), and motor sports (making quick decisions on the racetrack).
        
*   **Coordination:** The ability of a person to have all the skills (power, agility, speed, balance) to achieve a good hand-eye or foot-eye coordination.
    
    *   **Examples:** Cricket (combining power, agility, speed, balance, and reaction time for batting and running between wickets), hockey, and basketball.
        

**Important Note:** Most sports involve more than one skill-related fitness component. To excel in a sport, individuals often need to develop multiple skills, with certain skills dominating over others depending on the specific activity (e.g., balance is paramount in equestrian sports like polo, even though power is also involved).

3\. Estimating Calories Burned from Exercise
--------------------------------------------

While tracking calories consumed is generally more accurate for fat loss goals, it's possible to estimate calories burned during exercise.

*   **Metabolic Equivalent (MET) Values:**
    
    *   Scientists use MET values (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) to quantify the energy expenditure of various activities.
        
    *   One MET is defined as the metabolic rate at rest, where approximately 3.5 milliliters of oxygen are consumed per kilogram of body weight per minute.
        
    *   Higher MET values indicate higher intensity and calorie expenditure.
        
    *   These values are often derived from laboratory settings, typically based on a 70 kg individual, and thus represent approximations rather than exact figures.
        
*   **Formula for Energy Burned Per Minute:**
    
    *   Calories burned per minute = (MET value × 3.5 × Body Weight in kg) / 200
        
    *   **Example:** For an 80 kg person doing circuit training (MET value of 8):
        
        *   (8 × 3.5 × 80) / 200 = 11.2 calories per minute.
            
        *   If performed for one hour (60 minutes), the estimated burn is 11.2 calories/minute \* 60 minutes = 672 calories.
            
*   **Limitations and Practical Considerations:**
    
    *   **Approximation:** The calculated calories burned are approximate. Real-world factors like environment (air conditioning, outdoor conditions), rest periods, and individual variations influence actual energy expenditure.
        
    *   **Activity Duration vs. Actual Work:** Smartwatches and fitness trackers use similar MET-based formulas, often asking for personal details like body weight. However, they continuously track "workout time" even during warm-ups, rest periods, or casual conversation at the gym, which can inflate the reported calorie burn compared to actual active work.
        
    *   **Focus on Intake:** For weight management goals (fat loss or muscle gain), it is generally more accurate and reliable to focus on calculating and tracking _calories taken in_ rather than trying to precisely measure _calories burned out_ from exercise.
        

4\. Unit Summary
----------------

*   **Fitness Components:** Reviewed health-related fitness components and thoroughly discussed skill-related fitness components (power, balance, speed, agility, reaction time, and coordination).
    
*   **Multi-Skill Sports:** Emphasized that most sports require the development and mastery of multiple skills, not just one, and that some skills may dominate over others in specific sports.
    
*   **Energy Expenditure:** Learned methods for estimating calorie expenditure during exercise using MET values, while acknowledging the inherent approximations and practical problems with accurately measuring calories burned in real-world settings.
    
*   **Practical Application:** This understanding helps in prescribing appropriate exercises for clients based on their fitness goals and analyzing their approximate calorie expenditure.
