Basic Biology and Chemistry
===========================

This unit introduces fundamental concepts in biology and chemistry relevant to nutrition and human physiology. It covers the organization of the human body, basic chemical structures, and types of chemical reactions.

1\. Introduction to Basic Biology and Chemistry
-----------------------------------------------

Understanding basic biology and chemistry is crucial for comprehending how the human body functions, especially in the context of nutrition and exercise. These foundational concepts will be applied in later modules.

2\. Organization of the Human Body
----------------------------------

The human body is a complex biological machinery, organized in a hierarchical manner from the simplest to the most complex structures:

*   **Chemical Level:** This is the most basic level, involving atoms and molecules. For example, oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) are common atoms in the body. These combine to form molecules like water (H2​O), proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
    
*   **Cellular Level:** Cells are the basic structural and functional units of life. Molecules combine to form organelles, which are the functional components within a cell (e.g., mitochondria, nucleus). Examples of cells include muscle cells, nerve cells, and blood cells.
    
*   **Tissue Level:** Tissues are groups of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function. There are four basic types of tissues:
    
    *   **Epithelial Tissue:** Covers body surfaces and lines internal organs and cavities.
        
    *   **Connective Tissue:** Supports and connects other tissues and organs (e.g., bone, blood, cartilage, fat).
        
    *   **Muscle Tissue:** Responsible for movement (e.g., skeletal, cardiac, smooth muscles).
        
    *   **Nervous Tissue:** Transmits electrical signals throughout the body (e.g., brain, spinal cord, nerves).
        
*   **Organ Level:** Organs are structures composed of two or more different types of tissues that work together to perform complex functions (e.g., heart, lungs, stomach, brain).
    
*   **Organ System Level:** Organ systems are groups of organs that cooperate to achieve a major physiological function. Examples include the digestive system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, muscular system, skeletal system, nervous system, and endocrine system.
    
*   **Organismal Level:** This is the highest level of organization, representing the complete living being. All organ systems work together to maintain the life and health of the organism.
    

3\. Basic Chemistry: Atoms, Elements, and Molecules
---------------------------------------------------

*   **Atoms:** The smallest unit of an element that retains the chemical identity of that element. They consist of a nucleus (protons and neutrons) and electrons orbiting the nucleus.
    
*   **Elements:** Pure substances consisting of only one type of atom (e.g., Hydrogen, Oxygen, Carbon). There are 118 known elements, with 92 occurring naturally. The human body is composed of about 20 elements, with Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen making up approximately 96% of the body's mass.
    
*   **Molecules:** Formed when two or more atoms bond together. These can be elements (e.g., O2​) or compounds (e.g., H2​O).
    
*   **Ions:** Atoms that have gained or lost electrons, resulting in a net electrical charge (positive or negative). Ions are crucial for many bodily functions, such as nerve impulses and muscle contraction.
    

4\. Chemical Bonds
------------------

Atoms form chemical bonds to achieve stability (usually by completing their outermost electron shell).

*   **Ionic Bonds:** Form when one atom _transfers_ electrons to another, creating oppositely charged ions that attract each other.
    
    *   Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl) – Sodium gives an electron to Chlorine.
        
*   **Covalent Bonds:** Form when atoms _share_ electrons.
    
    *   **Nonpolar Covalent Bond:** Electrons are shared equally (e.g., O2​).
        
    *   **Polar Covalent Bond:** Electrons are shared unequally, creating slight positive and negative poles within the molecule (e.g., H2​O). This unequal sharing leads to hydrogen bonds.
        
*   **Hydrogen Bonds:** A weak attraction between a slightly positive hydrogen atom in one polar molecule and a slightly negative atom (like oxygen or nitrogen) in another polar molecule. Crucial for the structure of water, proteins, and DNA.
    

5\. pH and Solutions
--------------------

*   **pH (Potential of Hydrogen):** A measure of the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of a solution. It quantifies the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution.
    
    *   **Scale:** Ranges from 0 to 14.
        
        *   **0-6.9:** Acidic (higher H+ concentration).
            
        *   **7.0:** Neutral.
            
        *   **7.1-14:** Alkaline/Basic (lower H+ concentration).
            
    *   **Body pH:** The human body maintains a tightly regulated pH range, especially in blood (around 7.35-7.45), because enzymes and proteins are sensitive to pH changes. Deviations can impact metabolism and overall health.
        
*   **Solution:** A homogeneous mixture where one substance (solute) is dissolved in another (solvent).
    
    *   **Solute:** The substance being dissolved (e.g., sugar, salt).
        
    *   **Solvent:** The substance doing the dissolving (e.g., water). Water is the universal solvent in the body.
        
*   **Types of Solutions in the Body:**
    
    *   **Intracellular Fluid:** Fluid inside cells.
        
    *   **Extracellular Fluid:** Fluid outside cells, including interstitial fluid (between cells) and plasma (in blood).
        

6\. Types of Chemical Reactions
-------------------------------

Chemical reactions involve the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. There are four main types of reactions in the body:

*   **Synthesis Reaction (Anabolic Reaction):** Two or more small molecules combine to form a larger, more complex molecule. Energy is usually _absorbed_ (endergonic).
    
    *   Example: Amino acids combining to form a protein; Glucose molecules combining to form glycogen.
        
*   **Decomposition Reaction (Catabolic Reaction):** A larger molecule breaks down into two or more smaller molecules. Energy is usually _released_ (exergonic).
    
    *   Example: Digestion of food (carbohydrates breaking down into glucose); Glycogen breaking down into glucose for energy.
        
*   **Exchange Reaction:** Atoms or groups of atoms are exchanged between two reacting molecules, forming two new compounds. It involves both synthesis and decomposition.
    
    *   Example: The reaction between ATP and creatine phosphate during muscle contraction to produce energy.
        
*   **Reversible Reaction:** A reaction that can proceed in both forward and reverse directions simultaneously.
    
    *   Example: The formation and breakdown of carbonic acid in the blood to buffer pH.
