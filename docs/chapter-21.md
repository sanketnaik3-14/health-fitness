Planes of Motion
================

This unit introduces the technical terms that describe movement in the human body, anatomical positions, and spatial placement terms. It then delves into the three imaginary planes of motion: sagittal, coronal, and transverse, and their related movements.

1\. Introduction to Anatomy and Physiology
------------------------------------------

*   **Anatomy:** The study of the structure of the human body. For example, knowing where organs like the gallbladder, intestines, or esophagus are located.
    
*   **Physiology:** The study of the processes or functions within the human body. For example, understanding how protein or carbohydrates are metabolized and digested.
    
*   **Importance:** Learning these terms and concepts is crucial for understanding body movements, appreciating further studies in this area, and correctly interpreting scientific articles that use these terms to describe exercises. Without this foundational knowledge, the understanding of complex concepts in anatomy and physiology remains incomplete.
    

2\. Anatomical Position (Neutral Position)
------------------------------------------

The anatomical position serves as a standard reference point for describing body movements and locations.

*   **Description:** The body is erect, standing with the head upright, eyes and toes facing forward. The upper limbs are at the sides with palms facing forward.
    
*   **Function:** All anatomical terms and movements like flexion and extension are defined relative to this starting point.
    

3\. Spatial/Anatomical Placement Terms
--------------------------------------

These terms describe the location of body parts relative to each other, using the anatomical position as a reference.

*   **Proximal and Distal (Pertaining to Limbs - Arms and Legs):**
    
    *   **Proximal:** The part of the limb closer to its origin point (where it attaches to the torso).
        
        *   Example: The shoulder is proximal to the elbow; the hip joint is proximal to the knee joint.
            
    *   **Distal:** The part of the limb further away from its origin point.
        
        *   Example: The elbow is distal to the shoulder; the ankle is distal to the knee joint.
            
    *   **Scope:** These terms are limited to the appendicular skeleton (limbs â€“ hands and legs), not the axial skeleton (central part of the body).
        
*   **Medial and Lateral:**
    
    *   **Medial:** The body part closer to the imaginary midline of the body.
        
        *   Example: The inner part of the knee is medial; the chest is medial compared to the forearm.
            
    *   **Lateral:** The body part further away from the imaginary midline of the body.
        
        *   Example: The outer part of the knee is lateral; the forearm is lateral compared to the chest.
            
*   **Superior and Inferior:**
    
    *   **Superior:** Refers to what is above something.
        
        *   Example: The head is superior to the feet; the chest is superior to the abs.
            
    *   **Inferior:** Refers to what is below something.
        
        *   Example: The calves are inferior to the thighs; the abs are inferior to the chest.
            
*   **Anterior and Posterior:**
    
    *   **Anterior:** The front area of the body.
        
    *   **Posterior:** The back area of the body.
        
*   **Unilateral and Bilateral:**
    
    *   **Unilateral:** Involving one side of the body.
        
        *   Example: Alternate dumbbell curls.
            
    *   **Bilateral:** Involving both sides of the body.
        
        *   Example: Dumbbell press, barbell curls.
            
*   **Prone and Supine:**
    
    *   **Prone:** Facing down (e.g., lying on your stomach).
        
    *   **Supine:** Facing upwards (e.g., lying on your back). (Mnemonic: hold a "soup" bowl facing up).
        

4\. Planes of Motion
--------------------

The human body moves in three dimensions, which are described by three imaginary planes of motion. Any movement that occurs parallel to a plane belongs to that plane.

### 1\. Sagittal Plane (Anterior/Posterior or Median Plane):

*   **Divides the Body:** Into left and right halves.
    
*   **Movement Direction:** Involves forward and backward movements.
    
*   **Analogy:** Imagine being stuck between two infinite walls to your left and right, allowing movement only forwards and backwards.
    
*   **Joint Actions:**
    
    *   **Flexion:** A reduction (closing) in the angle between two bones attached to a joint.
        
        *   Example: Bicep curls (elbow flexion), squatting (knee and hip flexion).
            
    *   **Extension:** An increase (opening) in the angle between bones attached to a joint.
        
        *   Example: Straightening the arm from a bicep curl (elbow extension), standing up from a squat (knee and hip extension).
            
    *   **Hyperextension:** Over-stressing a body part by bending it backwards beyond its normal range.
        
    *   **Dorsiflexion (Ankle only):** Flexing the ankle joint, bringing the toes upwards (e.g., lifting foot off the gas pedal).
        
    *   **Plantarflexion (Ankle only):** Extending the ankle joint, pointing the toes downwards (e.g., pushing down on the gas pedal, standing on tiptoes for a calf raise).
        
*   **Examples of Exercises:** Bicep curls, triceps pushdowns, squats, front lunges, calf raises, walking, running, vertical jumping, climbing stairs.
    

### 2\. Coronal Plane (Frontal or Lateral Plane):

*   **Divides the Body:** Into front (anterior) and back (posterior) halves.
    
*   **Movement Direction:** Involves side-to-side movements.
    
*   **Analogy:** Imagine being stuck between two infinite walls in front and behind you, allowing movement only sideways.
    
*   **Joint Actions:**
    
    *   **Abduction:** Movement of a body part _away_ from the midline of the body.
        
        *   Example: Raising your hand sideways (lateral raises), raising your leg sideways (hip abduction).
            
    *   **Adduction:** Movement of a body part _towards_ the midline of the body. (Mnemonic: "Adduct" sounds like "add to," bringing something closer).
        
        *   Example: Bringing your leg back towards the body from a side raise, bringing your arm back down from a lateral raise.
            
*   **Examples of Exercises:** Side lateral raises, side lunges, side shuffling, crab walks.
    
*   **Circumduction (Compound Movement):** A circular movement that combines flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. It is a compound movement shared by both the sagittal and coronal planes, where the proximal part of the limb is fixed and the distal part moves in a circle.
    
    *   Examples: Arm circles, neck circles, ankle circles.
        

### 3\. Transverse Plane (Horizontal or Axial Plane):

*   **Divides the Body:** Into top (superior) and bottom (inferior) halves.
    
*   **Movement Direction:** Primarily involves rotational or twisting movements around a vertical axis.
    
*   **Analogy:** Imagine a horizontal cut across your waist, allowing your upper and lower body to twist relative to each other.
    
*   **Joint Actions:**
    
    *   **Medial Rotation (Internal Rotation):** Rotation of a body part towards the midline.
        
    *   **Lateral Rotation (External Rotation):** Rotation of a body part away from the midline.
        
*   **Examples of Exercises:** Cable rotations, chest flies (e.g., cable crossover), throwing (like a baseball pitch), golfing swings, batting (pull shot in cricket), Russian twists.
    

5\. Conclusion on Planes of Motion
----------------------------------

Understanding these anatomical planes and terms is fundamental for accurately describing body movements, which is crucial for:

*   Interpreting exercise science articles.
    
*   Appreciating the full range of motion the body can achieve.
    
*   Understanding which muscles work in which movements.
    
*   Designing comprehensive and balanced training routines.For example, many bodyweight training routines are dominant in the sagittal plane, focusing only on forward and backward movements. A complete understanding of planes helps in designing more diverse and effective programs.
