Exercise Planning
=================

This unit focuses on beginner training plans, exercise ordering, sample plans, progression tips, and practical advice for designing effective training programs. It is crucial for coaches as a significant portion of their clientele will be beginners.

1\. General Layout of Training Plans for Beginners
--------------------------------------------------

The primary objective for a beginner's training plan is to help them gain basic strength, mobility, and build work capacity. While any training plan can yield results for a beginner, a coach's goal is to find the most optimal way to train them, prioritizing their safety and minimizing injury risk.

### General Recommendations for Beginners:

*   **Training Frequency per Muscle Group:** 2-3 times a week.
    
*   **Total Training Days:** 3-5 days a week.
    
*   **Training Intensity:** 10-15 Repetition Maximum (RM).
    
*   **Training Volume:** 6-15 working sets per muscle group per week.
    
*   **Rest Period:** Less than 30 seconds.
    

These recommendations serve as a baseline for reference. The ideal goal is to aim for a 10-20% improvement from their current training status. When working with clients who have some training experience, assess their existing training split, exercise selection, exercise order, and weekly and per-session volume.

2\. Exercise Ordering
---------------------

Exercise ordering is a critical component in a training program as it significantly impacts training adaptations and overall results.

*   **Impact of Fatigue Carryover:** As the training session progresses, fatigue accumulates. Exercises performed later in the session will see a drop in quality due to fatigue.
    
*   **Order Based on Goals:**
    
    *   **Strength Training:** Compound exercises (multi-joint movements engaging multiple muscle groups) should always be placed first in the session when training for strength, as they are more fatiguing.
        
    *   **Weak Muscle Groups:** If a client has specific weak muscle groups, exercises targeting these should be prioritized at the beginning of the session.
        
    *   **General Training/Time Efficiency:** For general training or for individuals with limited time (e.g., only 30-40 minutes per session, or training 1-2 times a week), compound exercises should be prioritized. They are more time-efficient as they train multiple muscle groups simultaneously, offering a greater return on time investment.
        
*   **Impact on Adaptations:** Exercise ordering is crucial for improving muscular strength. However, it does not have a significant impact on muscular hypertrophy (muscle growth).
    

3\. Sample Training Plans for Beginners
---------------------------------------

Sample exercise plans illustrate how exercises are ordered and recommended sets/repetitions. These plans are examples and should be customized for the individual.

*   **Full Body 3x/Week Plan:** A full-body resistance training routine performed three times a week.
    
*   **Resistance Training & Cardio Combined (3x/Week):** Features two days of resistance training and one day dedicated to cardio and abs.
    
*   **Resistance Training & Yoga Combined (3x/Week):** A sample plan incorporating resistance training with yoga. For example, Day 1 could be upper body, Day 2 lower body, and Day 3 yoga/core.
    

4\. Progression as a Beginner
-----------------------------

Progression is vital for continued adaptation and results.

*   **Top Priority:** Focus on improving exercise form and technique.
    
*   **Gradually Increase Load:** Once comfortable with the form, gradually increase the weight or load in exercises.
    
*   **Increase Volume:** This can be done through various methods:
    
    *   Adding more exercises to the routine.
        
    *   Increasing the number of sets for the same exercises.
        
    *   Changing the training split (e.g., from a push/pull/legs split to a full-body training, which increases frequency for muscle groups and thus volume).
        
    *   Increasing the number of training days per week (e.g., from 3 to 4 days).
        

All these factors cumulatively contribute to an increase in overall training volume.

5\. Practical Tips for Designing a Training Plan
------------------------------------------------

### Tracking Progress

*   **Workout Journal:** Keep a detailed log of workouts, including weights lifted, perceived exertion, and overall quality of the session.
    
*   **Strength Testing:** Test strength every 8-10 weeks using 1RM (one-rep max) or repetition max tests for major lifts like squat, bench press, and deadlift. This is particularly relevant if strength is the primary goal.
    
*   **Hypertrophy/Fat Loss Tracking:** If hypertrophy (muscle growth) is the goal, take periodic pictures (e.g., every 30 days). For fat loss, use a tape measure to track circumference changes in various body parts.
    

### Dos and Don'ts for Coaches:

*   **Do Keep it Simple:** Focus on basic movements that are easy to follow and promote consistency. The aim is to introduce exercise as a lifestyle change, not just a complex workout program.
    
*   **Do Emphasize Correct Form and Technique:** Prioritize proper execution over heavy lifting to minimize injury risk. Refer to exercise videos for guidance on form.
    
*   **Do Discuss Benefits:** Explain the "why" behind exercise by discussing its research-backed benefits beyond just fat loss (e.g., muscle maintenance, bone density, disease risk reduction) to encourage and motivate clients.
    
*   **Don't Force Location:** Don't insist on a gym if a client prefers home or outdoor workouts. Movement and consistency are more important than the specific location, especially initially.
    
*   **Don't Emphasize Heavy Lifting Prematurely:** Focus on learning basic movements with correct form and technique before attempting heavy or "ego" lifting.
    
*   **Don't Force Supplementation:** If a client might need supplements, refer them to a physician for proper diagnosis of deficiencies before recommending any.
    

6\. Unit Summary (Practical Applications)
-----------------------------------------

*   The main objective of advising workouts to the general population is to introduce exercise as a sustainable lifestyle change, fostering consistency and adherence.
    
*   Focus on basic movements with correct form and technique, avoiding heavy lifting or training to technical failure in the initial stages.
    
*   Customize workouts based on individual goals, lifestyle, preferred training location, and equipment availability. This customization leads to better consistency, adherence, and results.
    
*   Ensure the workout plan custom-fits the client's lifestyle for optimal long-term success.
