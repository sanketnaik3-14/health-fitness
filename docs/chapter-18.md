Training Variables
==================

This unit aims to explain different training variables and their importance when planning an exercise program for a client. It covers intensity, repetition range, sets, training volume, exercise ordering, repetition tempo, inter-set rest period, and training frequency.

1\. Intensity
-------------

Intensity is a crucial exercise variable representing the load or weight a person lifts during an exercise. It provides a major stimulus to muscles, leading to changes in strength and muscular endurance. As experience grows, beginners progressively increase their lifting intensity.

*   **Absolute Intensity:** Measured as a percentage of repetition maximum (RM).
    
    *   **1RM (One Repetition Maximum):** The maximum weight a person can lift with acceptable form for one repetition.
        
    *   **Repetition Maximum (RM):** The maximum weight lifted with acceptable form for a given number of repetitions (e.g., 2RM, 5RM).
        
*   **Relative Intensity:** The effort a person puts within a particular set or session.
    
    *   Measured using tools like the **Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Board Scale** or **Reps in Reserve (RIR)**.
        
    *   **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion):** A scale from 0 (rest) to 10 (maximal effort) that gauges how hard an activity feels. Developed by Gunnar Borg, it rates exertion and breathlessness. For example, if the last two repetitions of a 12-rep set are very hard (RPE 7), it means 2 RIR (reps in reserve).
        

2\. Repetition Range
--------------------

Intensity (load) and repetitions have an inverse relationship.

*   **High Intensity / Low Repetitions (1-5 reps):** Used when lifting heavy loads. For example, 50 kg squats for 5 repetitions.
    
*   **Moderate Intensity / Moderate Repetitions (6-12 reps):** For example, 25 kg squats for 10 repetitions.
    
*   **Low Intensity / High Repetitions (13+ reps):** For example, 10 kg squats for 25 repetitions.
    

In all these examples, if the weight \* number of reps is kept constant (e.g., 250 kg in the examples above), the training volume remains the same, despite varying intensity and reps.

3\. Training Volume
-------------------

Training volume represents the total amount of work done in a particular session or set.

*   **Formula:** Volume = Weight lifted × Number of sets performed × Number of repetitions in a particular set.
    
*   **Set Volume:** Refers to the number of effective sets performed where the relative intensity (RPE) is greater than or equal to 7, or the RIR (reps in reserve) is less than or equal to 3. This means the last 1-3 repetitions in those sets are very challenging.
    

4\. Principle of Progressive Overload
-------------------------------------

Progressive overload is crucial for continuous gains and improved performance. It forces the body to adapt to greater tension or stimulus. You cannot always lift the same weight; you need to gradually increase the demands on your muscles as your training experience grows.

*   **Ways to Increase Volume (for progressive overload):**
    
    *   **Increasing Sets:** Add more sets to an exercise if you cannot immediately increase the load or repetitions. For example, moving from 3 sets to 4 sets. This is often useful for beginners.
        
    *   **Increasing Repetitions:** Increase the number of repetitions within each set. For example, moving from 10 reps to 12 reps per set. This increases total workout duration. Adaptations lean towards muscular endurance.
        
    *   **Increasing Load (Weight):** This is generally the most effective way to achieve higher volume and leads to significant improvements in muscular strength, connective tissues, and neural factors. Adding low-load sets after high-load sets can also contribute to hypertrophy.
        

You don't need to increase all three variables simultaneously; focusing on one or two can effectively increase overall training volume.

5\. Exercise Ordering
---------------------

The order of exercises in a training plan is important as it impacts training adaptations and performance.

*   **Prioritizing High Volume/Compound Exercises:** Exercises that involve multiple muscle groups (compound exercises) and allow for high volume should generally be performed at the beginning of a session.
    
    *   **Reason:** Fatigue carryover. If high-volume exercises are placed at the end, the individual may lack the energy to perform them effectively, leading to suboptimal performance.
        
    *   **Example:** For strength-focused training, always start with multi-joint (compound) exercises.
        
*   **Addressing Weak Muscle Groups:** If a client has a particular weak muscle group, specific exercises targeting that group can be placed at the beginning of the session to ensure fresh energy is dedicated to improving it.
    
*   **Training Bigger Muscles First:** When multiple muscle groups are trained in one session, prioritize larger muscle groups first (e.g., quadriceps before calves).
    
*   **Impact on Strength vs. Hypertrophy:** Exercise ordering is very important for improving muscular strength. However, it has no significant impact on muscular hypertrophy (muscle growth).
    

6\. Repetition Tempo
--------------------

Repetition tempo refers to how fast or slow you lift the weight (concentric phase) and lower it back to the original position (eccentric phase).

*   **Avoid Extremes:** Performing exercises too fast or too slow can be suboptimal:
    
    *   **Too Slow:** Puts greater stress on the system, increases injury risk, wastes effort, and reduces overall training volume/performance.
        
    *   **Too Fast:** Creates momentum, which decreases effective muscle contraction and can stress joints, increasing injury risk.
        
*   **Recommended Tempo:** Generally, a 1-second concentric (lifting) phase and a 2-second eccentric (lowering) phase is recommended. For example, in a bicep curl, lift for 1 second and lower for 2 seconds.
    
*   **When to Emphasize Tempo:** Repetition tempo is crucial for:
    
    *   **Beginners:** To help them learn proper form and technique, develop mind-muscle connection, and ensure controlled movement.
        
    *   **Individuals with Injuries:** To control movement and minimize stress on vulnerable body parts.
        
*   **Not a Primary Variable for Experienced Lifters:** For advanced lifters, intuitively changing tempo based on the lift is more common. It is generally not a primary variable to manipulate for progressive overload or hypertrophy goals, unlike load, reps, or sets. Micro-loading (adding very small amounts of weight) can be challenging if relying solely on tempo manipulation.
    

7\. Inter-set Rest Period
-------------------------

The inter-set rest period is the time taken to rest between consecutive sets of an exercise.

*   **Impact on Performance:**
    
    *   **Shorter Rest Periods:** Can reduce performance in the subsequent set due to "fatigue carryover."
        
    *   **Longer Rest Periods:** Can increase overall workout duration.
        
*   **Ideal Rest Period Recommendations:**
    
    *   **Low Load Training (Low Intensity):** Shorter rest periods (30-60 seconds) are acceptable. Hypertrophy is generally independent of rest intervals in this context.
        
    *   **Moderate to High Load Training (High Intensity):** Longer rest periods (greater than 90 seconds) are usually necessary to allow for sufficient recovery between sets, as the body is lifting heavy loads.
        

8\. Training Frequency
----------------------

Training frequency refers to how many times a particular muscle group is trained in a week.

*   **Volume Equalization:** When total training volume is equalized, both high and low training frequencies can be equally effective in improving strength and hypertrophy.
    
*   **Optimal Strategy:** Achieving high volume across multiple sessions in a week (e.g., splitting a leg workout into two sessions instead of one very long, high-volume session) can be more effective for overall volume and recovery.
    
*   **Recovery Ability:** Extremely high frequency training without adequate rest can negatively affect recovery.
    
*   **Finding the Optimal Frequency:** The best frequency for an individual maximizes strength gains and allows for full recovery before the next training session for that muscle group.

*   **Practical Application:** Learned how to manipulate these variables to design effective exercise programs, particularly for beginners.
    
*   **Key Principles:** Progressive overload is crucial. Choosing variables that promote recovery is also vital. The choice of training variables depends on individual goals, experience, and the specific adaptations desired (strength, endurance, hypertrophy).
