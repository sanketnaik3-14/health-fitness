### Quantified Nutrition

This unit defines quantified nutrition, emphasizes its importance in meal planning, discusses precautions when measuring food, and debunks common diet myths.

#### 1\. What is Quantified Nutrition and Why is it Important?

*   Definition: Quantified nutrition involves precisely measuring and tracking food intake to meet specific energy (calorie) and macronutrient requirements.
    
*   Individual Needs: Every person has unique energy requirements based on their body, lifestyle, and goals (e.g., weight maintenance, loss, or gain).
    
    *   Lifestyles differ across regions and cultures, influencing dietary needs.
        
*   Managing Intake: Quantifying food helps prevent excessive weight gain that might result from emotional eating, binge eating, or increased appetite due to medication.
    
*   Calorie Awareness: It allows individuals to understand their approximate caloric needs and begin meal planning effectively.
    

#### 2\. Precautions When Quantifying Food

*   Measure Raw Food: Always measure food in its raw state rather than cooked.
    
    *   Cooked food weight can vary due to water absorption (e.g., rice) or evaporation, making measurements inaccurate.
        
*   Measure Cooking Oil/Fat: Do not eyeball cooking oil or ghee, as fats are calorie-dense (9 kcal/gram). Measuring ensures accurate calorie tracking.
    
*   Account for Fruits and Vegetables: Although generally low in calories, fruits and vegetables contain calories and should not be consumed in unlimited quantities.
    
    *   Calorie content varies significantly between different types (e.g., spinach and lettuce have fewer calories than peas, carrots, beetroot, or potatoes). Always keep quantities in mind.
        

#### 3\. Planning a Diet: Calculating Calorie Needs

To plan a diet for yourself or someone else, follow these steps:

*   Not 100% Accurate: Online BMR/TDEE calculators provide estimations or approximations, not exact answers. They serve as a reference value to start with.
    
*   Cannot Account for Body Composition: They cannot differentiate between muscle and fat mass for individuals of the same height, weight, and age, leading to inaccurate BMR/TDEE calculations.
    
*   Do Not Account for Metabolic Issues: Calculators don't factor in metabolic conditions like diabetes, PCOS, or thyroid issues, which can affect BMR.
    
*   Adjustment Needed: After starting with a calculated TDEE, a person's response over 7-10 days will indicate whether calorie intake needs to be adjusted based on their progress and goals.
    
*   Limitations of Online Calculators:
    

#### 4\. Setting Up Calories Based on Goal

*   Weight Maintenance: Calories in = Calories out (TDEE).
    
*   Fat Loss: Calories in < Calories out (TDEE).
    
    *   Example: If TDEE is 2300 kcal, a deficit of 300 kcal sets intake to 2000 kcal.
        
*   Muscle Gain: Calories in > Calories out (TDEE).
    
*   Macronutrient Distribution Example (for 2000 kcal diet):
    
    *   Protein: Start with 1.2-1.6 g/kg body weight (can go up to 1.8-2.2 g/kg depending on activity). For an 83.33 kg person, 1.2 g/kg equals 100g protein (400 kcal).
        
    *   Fat: 20-35% of total calories. For 2000 kcal, 20% is 400 kcal. Since fat provides 9 kcal/gram, this is ~44.44g of fat.
        
    *   Carbohydrates: The remaining calories. For 2000 kcal, after 400 kcal from protein and 400 kcal from fat, 1200 kcal remain for carbs. Since carbs provide 4 kcal/gram, this is 300g of carbs.
        
    *   Flexibility: These macro combinations can be altered based on client comfort, diet history, and cultural beliefs. They are not fixed.
        
*   Tracking: Once calories and macros are set, measure food and track intake to meet the target.
    

#### 5\. Common Diet Myths

*   "Breakfast like a king, dinner like a pauper": This is a myth. The total caloric intake throughout the day is what matters for weight loss, gain, or maintenance. Dinner should provide adequate nutrients for overnight recovery from daily activities and workouts.
    
*   "No eating after 7 PM": This is also a myth. Any weight loss observed is often due to a longer fasting period between the last meal and morning weigh-in, leading to a temporary water weight drop, not increased fat loss. Again, total daily calories are paramount.
    
*   "Quit rice and wheat to lose weight": Quitting these carbohydrate sources only results in temporary water weight loss, not significant fat loss.
    
*   "Fasted cardio helps lose weight faster": Research shows no significant difference in fat loss speed between fasted and fed cardio. Fat loss depends on overall daily caloric intake.
    
*   "Quit sugar and oil completely to become fit": This is a temporary and unsustainable solution. While it cuts calories, completely eliminating these often leads to a "yo-yo effect" where individuals eventually break down, overeat, and regain weight (surplus eating). Calorie reduction should be done smartly and sustainably for long-term adherence.
