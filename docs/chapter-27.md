Exercise Physiology
===================

This unit focuses on exercise physiology, explaining how the body responds and adapts to physical stress. It covers the principles of exercise physiology, acute and chronic responses to training, components of physical training, and system-specific responses.

1\. Introduction to Exercise Physiology
---------------------------------------

Exercise physiology is the study of how the human body responds and adapts to physical stress.

*   **Physiology:** Refers to the normal functioning of the human body.
    
*   **Stressors:** While there are various types of stressors (trauma, disease, anxiety, illness), exercise is considered a **positive physical stress**.
    
*   **Intentional Stress:** Exercise is undertaken intentionally to produce beneficial acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) effects or adaptations for overall well-being.
    

2\. Principles of Exercise Physiology: Stress and Adaptation
------------------------------------------------------------

The core principles of exercise physiology revolve around the body's response to stress and its subsequent adaptations.

*   **Stress:** The body's basic demand is energy. When increased physical activity (exercise) is introduced, the stress on the body increases because the energy demand rises. To meet this increased demand, the body must work harder and use more energy.
    
*   **Acute Responses:** These are the immediate, short-term physiological changes the body exhibits to meet the increased demand for oxygen during exercise.
    
    *   **Increased Blood Supply:** As metabolic activity increases, there's a greater demand for oxygen and glucose in the muscles. The body responds by increasing blood supply. Vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) occurs, leading to increased blood flow, which delivers more oxygen and glucose and removes carbon dioxide and metabolic waste products.
        
    *   **Increased Muscle Temperature:** Muscles generate heat as a waste product when they break down fuel (fats and carbohydrates) to produce energy. This leads to an increase in muscle temperature.
        
    *   **Increased Muscle Pliability:** The warming of muscles during activity makes them more pliable and flexible (more adaptable for movement). Pliable muscles are less prone to injuries like muscle strains. A good warm-up enhances this pliability, improving joint flexibility as warm muscles stretch better.
        
    *   **Micro Tears:** During resistance training, muscles undergo stress, leading to tiny, beneficial tears in muscle fibers. These micro-tears cause post-workout swelling and soreness. They heal through muscle protein synthesis (using protein), resulting in muscle hypertrophy (growth). These are not harmful but are a normal physiological process of adaptation.
        
*   **Chronic Adaptations:** These are the gradual, long-term physiological changes that occur from repeated bouts of stress (consistent exercise over time).
    
    *   **System Efficiency:** The body's systems become more efficient at handling stress. The same activity that once felt very stressful now feels less so.
        
    *   **Improved Performance:** This is a primary goal of consistent training, as systems become more efficient. For example, a runner will see their systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, endocrine) respond less dramatically to the same run over time.
        
    *   **Example (Running/Swimming):** When a person first starts running or swimming, their heart rate and breathing rate immediately increase (acute response) to meet oxygen demand. With continued training, their body adapts, resulting in a lower heart rate at the same intensity, indicating improved efficiency and better performance with less energy expenditure.
        

3\. Components of Physical Training
-----------------------------------

Physical training involves two main categories of components:

*   **Health-Related Components:** Focus on the body's ability to work and perform daily activities without fatigue. These are fundamental for overall well-being.
    
    *   Flexibility
        
    *   Strength (Muscular Strength)
        
    *   Cardiovascular Endurance
        
    *   Muscular Endurance
        
    *   Body Composition (maintaining a healthy one)
        
*   **Skill-Related Components:** These components are specific to athletic performance and activities requiring motor skills.
    
    *   Power (e.g., for vertical jump in basketball)
        
    *   Speed (e.g., for faster sprints)
        
    *   Agility
        
    *   Balance
        
    *   Reaction Time
        
    *   Coordination
        

4\. System Responses to Training
--------------------------------

Exercise impacts various physiological systems, causing both acute responses and chronic adaptations.

### a. Cardiovascular System Responses:

*   **Acute Responses (During Exercise):**
    
    *   **Increased Heart Rate:** Number of beats per minute increases.
        
    *   **Increased Stroke Volume:** The volume of blood the heart pumps out per beat increases. This increase is typically limited to 40-60% of a person's maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), after which it plateaus.
        
    *   **Increased Cardiac Output:** The product of heart rate and stroke volume (Heart Rate Ã— Stroke Volume) increases as the rate of work increases. This is a crucial indicator of the circulatory system's ability to meet the demands of physical activity.
        
    *   **Blood Pressure Changes:**
        
        *   **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP):** Increases linearly with increasing exercise intensity, reflecting the pressure when the heart actively beats.
            
        *   **Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP):** Remains relatively constant, regardless of exercise intensity, representing the pressure in arteries between heartbeats.
            

### b. Respiratory System Responses:

*   **Main Job:** To absorb oxygen from the atmosphere into the blood and deliver it to muscles and organs via the cardiovascular system.
    
*   **Acute Responses (During Exercise):**
    
    *   **Increased Respiratory Rate:** The number of breaths per minute increases. This means more oxygen is absorbed and more carbon dioxide is removed from the blood.
        
    *   **Increased Respiratory Exchange Rate:** The body breathes in more oxygen and exhales more carbon dioxide.
        
*   **VO2 Max (Volume of Oxygen Maximum):**
    
    *   **Definition:** The maximal volume of oxygen that the body can consume and utilize during maximal effort. A higher VO2 max means more oxygen is available to be delivered to the muscles.
        
    *   **Genetics vs. Training:** VO2 max is largely dependent on genetics, though it can be improved with training up to a certain limitation.
        
    *   **Performance vs. Oxygen Consumption:** While oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is important, how efficiently the body _uses_ that available oxygen is equally crucial for performance.
        
    *   **Plateau:** Oxygen consumption increases with running speed, but after a point, due to limitations of the circulatory and respiratory systems, VO2 max reaches a plateau (anaerobic zone).
        
    *   **Measurement Challenges:** Accurately measuring VO2 max is difficult for the general population, requiring expensive maximal graded exercise tests in physiology labs. Wearable devices provide estimations but are not highly reliable.
        
    *   **VO2 Max and Heart Health (General Population):** A high VO2 max alone does not guarantee good heart health for the general population, as diet also plays a significant role.
        
    *   **Velocity at VO2 Max (vVO2max):** For athletes and coaches, the velocity at which VO2 max is reached is considered a better metric than VO2 max itself, as it indicates efficiency. This speed can be used as a feedback mechanism for training intensity, especially for interval workouts to improve anaerobic capacity.
        

### c. Musculoskeletal System Responses:

*   **Initiation of Movement:** Exercise involves muscle contractions. Skeletal muscles are voluntary and require a neurological signal (stimulus/electrical impulse from the brain via the spinal cord and nerves) and adequate neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine) to contract. Feedback mechanisms allow the brain to perform the action.
    
*   **Acute Responses (During Exercise):**
    
    *   Increased activity of the nervous system.
        
    *   Increased muscle and core temperature.
        
    *   Increased blood supply to replenish oxygen and glycogen as energy demand increases (vasodilation).
        
    *   Increased blood pressure at the onset of exercise.
        
    *   Muscle fatigue begins (usually noticeable halfway through a session).
        
    *   Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) begins after the activity.
        
*   **Chronic Adaptations (Long-Term, with Regular Training):**
    
    *   **Muscle Size (Hypertrophy):** Muscle size increases with resistance training.
        
    *   **Mitochondria and Myoglobin:** Increase in content (especially with regular endurance training).
        
    *   **Increased Muscle Strength:** Muscles become stronger, allowing heavier lifting (e.g., progression from 10kg to 30-40kg squats).
        
    *   **Increased Tolerance to Lactic Acid:** The body becomes more efficient at buffering or clearing lactic acid, reducing the "burn" sensation during high-rep training.
        
    *   **Increased Range of Motion (ROM):** Flexibility and joint mobility improve.
