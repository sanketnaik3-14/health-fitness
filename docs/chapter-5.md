### Macronutrients

This unit defines macronutrients and delves into the different types: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, discussing their classifications, benefits, and roles in the human body.

#### 1\. What are Macronutrients?

*   Definition: "Macro" means large quantity. Macronutrients are nutrients required by the body in large quantities to function efficiently.
    
*   Types: They are broadly classified into three types: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.
    
*   Overall Role: These nutrients perform numerous functions in the body, including providing energy and being essential for producing life-sustaining hormones. The balanced presence of all three is crucial for essential bodily functioning.
    

#### 2\. Carbohydrates (CHO)

*   Primary Function: Carbohydrates are the body's prime source of fuel or energy.
    
*   Caloric Value: They provide approximately 4 calories per gram.
    
*   Energy Supply: About 40-45% of the body's energy supply comes from carbohydrates.
    
*   Preferred Energy Source: The body prefers carbohydrates as its primary fuel source because they are the easiest to break down compared to proteins or fats.
    
*   Utilization:
    
    *   Instant Energy: Carbohydrates are converted into glucose (the simplest sugar molecule), which is then broken down through chemical reactions to provide instant energy.
        
    *   Storage: Excess carbohydrates are converted into glycogen (a complex structure) or fats, and then stored in your body for later use.
        

#### 3\. Classification of Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are classified based on the number of sugar molecules they contain:

*   Simple Carbohydrates:
    
    *   Monosaccharides (one sugar molecule):
        
        *   Glucose: Most abundantly found and the simplest form of sugar. Found in fruits, vegetables, honey, corn syrup, and high-fructose corn syrup.
            
        *   Fructose: Found naturally in fruits, fruit juices, some vegetables, and honey.
            
        *   Galactose: Found in dairy products, avocados, and sugar beets.
            
    *   Disaccharides (two sugar molecules): Formed when two monosaccharides combine. The body produces unique enzymes to break these down.
        
        *   Sucrose: Composed of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule. Digested by the enzyme sucrase.
            
        *   Lactose: Composed of one glucose molecule and one galactose molecule. Found in milk and milk products. Digested by the enzyme lactase.
            
*   Complex Carbohydrates:
    
    *   Oligosaccharides: Contain 3-10 sugar molecules (e.g., tri-saccharides (3), tetra-saccharides (4), penta-saccharides (5)).
        
    *   Polysaccharides: Contain a very large number of sugar molecules (monosaccharides) bound together.
        
        *   Homopolysaccharides: Made of similar monosaccharide units. Examples include:
            
            *   Starches: Storage form of sugars in plants (e.g., potatoes, grains, seeds, fruits).
                
            *   Glycogen: The reserve/storage form of glucose in animals, including humans. Stored mainly in the liver and skeletal muscle, it's broken down to release glucose when the body needs energy. Food does not directly contain glycogen; it's formed from consumed carbohydrates.
                
            *   Cellulose: Fibrous part of plants.
                
        *   Heteropolysaccharides: Made of different types of monosaccharide units. Examples include:
            
            *   Agar: Found in seaweeds.
                
            *   Vegetable gums: Used in pharmaceuticals.
                
            *   Hyaluronic acid: A lubricant and shock absorbent found in joint synovial fluid.
                

#### 4\. Benefits of Complex Carbohydrates and Fiber

*   Slow Release of Energy: Complex carbohydrates (like starches) take longer to break down into glucose. This slow release into the bloodstream prevents rapid insulin spikes.
    
*   Beneficial for Specific Conditions: They are an excellent energy source for individuals who have insulin resistance or diabetes.
    
*   Fiber:
    
    *   Source: Found in the structural substances of plants. Tough seed husks and fruit skins are rich in fiber.
        
    *   Indigestible: Human enzymes can only partially digest fiber.
        
    *   Benefits:
        
        *   Does not cause insulin spikes.
            
        *   Adds bulk to stool, relieving constipation.
            
        *   Helps excrete toxins and waste from the body.
            

#### 5\. Proteins

*   Building Blocks: Proteins are considered the most important macros because our body is basically made up of proteins. Muscles and hormones are made of proteins. They are the building blocks and structural component of our body.
    
*   Composition: Proteins are made up of smaller molecules called amino acids. When proteins are broken down, they yield amino acids, and when amino acids combine, they form proteins.
    
*   Caloric Value: Provide approximately 4 calories per gram.
    
*   Key Functions:
    
    *   Immune System: Form antibodies and immunoglobulins, which are the body's defense system against various infections.
        
    *   Skin, Hair, and Nails: Keratin, a protein, makes up hair, nails, and skin. Good protein intake influences their health.
        
    *   Nourishment and Renewal: Very crucial for the nourishment, renewal, and continuance of our life.
        
    *   Transport and Storage: Help in the transport and storage of different macro and micronutrients in our body.
        
    *   Enzymatic Action and Hormones: The enzymatic action also partly depends on proteins. Most of the hormones are made up of proteins.
        
*   Amino Acids: There are 20 different amino acids that make up proteins.
    
    *   Essential Amino Acids (9 types): Cannot be synthesized by our body, and we need to consume them through food.
        
    *   Non-Essential Amino Acids: Are produced by the body.
        

#### 6\. Protein Requirements

Protein requirements vary based on different populations:

*   Growing Age (Children, Adolescents): Will require higher amount of protein.
    
*   Pregnant Women: Have higher protein requirement as their intake will also help for the growth of the fetus.
    
*   Lactating Women: Require large amount of protein because the milk they produce is also protein in nature. They should be supplied with good quality of proteins to produce good quality of milk.
    
*   Athletes / Strength Training Individuals: People involved in sports or strength training require higher amount of protein for muscle recovery, as these activities cause muscle breakdown. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends 1.2 to 2 grams of protein per kg body weight per day for an athlete, depending on the type of training. The more intense the training, the more is the protein requirement.
    
*   General Health: Usually requires around 0.6 to 1.2 grams of protein per kg body weight. For example, a 50 kg person might need up to 60 grams of protein daily.
    

#### 7\. Dietary Sources of Protein

*   Non-Vegetarian Sources: Eggs, chicken, fish, and meat.
    
*   Vegetarian Sources: Milk and milk products (dairy products), beans, whole grains, nuts , soy and soy products, cheese, and paneer.
    

#### 8\. Fats (Lipids)

*   Essential for Survival: Humans cannot survive without fat because a lot of important hormones are made up of fat. Fats are required for survival of humans.
    
*   Calorie Density: Fats are the most calorie-dense macros out of all three. They provide approximately 9 calories per gram. Therefore, careful monitoring of fat intake (oil, ghee, butter) in cooking is essential.
    
*   Role in the Body:
    
    *   Taste and Texture: Fats enhance the taste and texture of food, making it more palatable and tasty.
        
    *   Protective Barrier for Cells: Fats provide a kind of insulation and protect the cells from different harmful chemicals. Every cell is made up of a bilipid layer, meaning the cell wall is made up of fat.
        
    *   High Energy Source: Provide double the energy compared to proteins and carbohydrates.
        
    *   Dissolving Vitamins: Essential for dissolving fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) for absorption in our circulation.
        
    *   Insulation and Padding: Fats insulate different organs of our body and various organs are lined by a layer of fat in order to protect them.
        
    *   Sustenance of Life: Very crucial for nourishment, energy production, and sustenance of life.
