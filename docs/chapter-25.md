Cardiovascular and Nervous Systems
==================================

This unit provides an overview of the cardiovascular and nervous systems, including their major components, structures, and vital physiological functions.

1\. Cardiovascular System
-------------------------

The cardiovascular system, also known as the circulatory or vascular system, regulates blood flow to ensure circulation and the transportation of nutrients throughout the body. The formal study of this system is called cardiology.

### Structure and Major Components:

*   **Heart:** A muscular organ located in the chest that pumps blood through blood vessels via repeated rhythmic contractions. It has its own rhythm for contractions.
    
    *   **Four Chambers:** The heart is divided into four chambers: right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle.
        
    *   **Blood Flow within Chambers:** Blood is pumped from the atrium (input chamber) to the ventricle (output chamber) below it, and from the ventricle, it is pumped out of the heart.
        
*   **Blood Vessels:** Numerous vessels that form a network throughout the body.
    
    *   **Arteries:** Carry blood _away_ from the heart.
        
    *   **Veins:** Carry blood _towards_ the heart.
        
    *   Examples include arteries, veins, arterioles, venules, and capillaries.
        
*   **Lungs:** Part of the pulmonary circulation.
    
    *   They carry deoxygenated blood away from the right ventricle into the lungs.
        
    *   In the lungs, gas exchange occurs (carbon dioxide leaves, oxygen enters the blood).
        
    *   Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium and ventricle of the heart.
        

### Blood Circulation Pathway:

1.  **Deoxygenated blood** from the body enters the **right atrium**.
    
2.  It moves to the **right ventricle**.
    
3.  A blood vessel takes this deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the **lungs**.
    
4.  In the lungs, blood becomes **oxygenated**.
    
5.  **Oxygenated blood** returns to the heart, entering the **left atrium**.
    
6.  It then moves into the **left ventricle**.
    
7.  From the left ventricle, an artery takes the oxygenated blood away from the heart to the rest of the body via **systemic circulation**.
    

### Blood Pressure:

Blood pressure is the measure of the pressure of circulating blood against the blood vessel walls.

*   **Systolic Blood Pressure:** The pressure generated when the heart pushes blood out to the rest of the body (during ventricular contraction). The normal reading is below 120 mmHg.
    
*   **Diastolic Blood Pressure:** The pressure in the vessels when the heart rests between two beats (when the heart is refilling with blood). The normal reading is below 80 mmHg.
    

### Functions of the Cardiovascular System:

*   Circulate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
    
*   Provide nutrients to cells.
    
*   Remove waste products of metabolism via excretory organs for disposal.
    
*   Protect the body against disease and infection.
    
*   Regulate body temperature and maintain homeostasis (internal balance).
    
*   Transport hormones to target cells and organs.
    
*   Stop bleeding after an injury (through clotting mechanisms involving blood components within the system).
    

2\. Nervous System
------------------

The nervous system (also known as the central nervous system) is a complex system comprising nerves that coordinate actions and sensory information within the body. It transmits signals to and from different parts of the body. The study of its functioning and disorders is called neurology.

### Structure and Major Components:

The nervous system is divided into two main parts:

*   **Central Nervous System (CNS):** The integration and command center of the body.
    
    *   **Brain:** The body's master control unit. It is divided into two main sections: the **cerebrum** (controls voluntary movements, intelligence, and memory) and the **cerebellum** (controls precision, coordination, timing, and posture).
        
    *   **Brain Stem:** Acts as a bridge connecting the brain with the spinal cord. It regulates heart rate, breathing, sleeping, and eating, and serves as a relay center between the cerebrum/cerebellum and the spinal cord.
        
    *   **Spinal Cord:** A crucial pathway for messages sent by the brain to the body and from the body to the brain. It consists of a column of nerves connecting the brain to the peripheral nervous system.
        
    *   In some definitions, the **retinas of the eyes** are also considered part of the CNS.
        
*   **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** This is the body's link to the outside world.
    
    *   It consists of nerves that connect the CNS to the upper and lower limbs (hands, arms, legs, feet).
        
    *   Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull, leaving it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries.
        
    *   **Nerve Cells (Neurons):** The nervous system's special cells that transmit signals between different body parts.
        
        *   Signals travel through fibers called **axons**.
            
        *   Chemicals called **neurotransmitters** are released at gaps called **synapses** for communication, occurring in fractions of a millisecond.
            
        *   Neurons are supported and fed by particular cells.
            

### Divisions of the Peripheral Nervous System:

The PNS is further divided into:

*   **Somatic Nervous System (Voluntary):** Under conscious control.
    
    *   Carries sensory signals from organs (e.g., skin, sensory receptors) to the CNS (sensory neurons).
        
    *   Relays motor commands from the CNS to muscles, controlling voluntary movements (motor neurons).
        
    *   Example: Touching a hot object â€“ sensory neurons detect heat, brain interprets, motor neurons command the hand to pull back.
        
*   **Autonomic Nervous System (Involuntary):** Largely acts unconsciously, regulating bodily functions not under conscious control.
    
    *   Regulates heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, and urination.
        
    *   Further divided into:
        
        *   **Sympathetic Nervous System:** Prepares the body for action and stress (often called "fight, flight, or freeze" response). Example: Running away from a dog.
            
        *   **Parasympathetic Nervous System:** Calms the body down and helps conserve energy ("rest and digest"). Example: Feeling relaxed while meditating or listening to music.
            

### Functions of the Nervous System:

*   Receive information about what is happening outside or within the body.
    
*   Bring this information to the brain for interpretation and analysis.
    
*   Generate a response based on the sensory information received.
    
*   Integrate information for processing and generating suitable outcomes.
    
*   Regulate homeostasis (maintaining balance) in bodily processes.
