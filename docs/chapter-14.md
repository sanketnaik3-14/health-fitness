Impact of Exercise
==================

This unit defines exercise, explains its importance and types, and describes its specific impacts on obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, aging, and brain health.

1\. What is Exercise?
---------------------

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines physical activity or exercise as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure.

2\. Importance of Exercise
--------------------------

Exercise, or any form of physical activity, can significantly improve the quality of life, extending not just lifespan but also the quality of that lifespan.

*   It reduces the risk of developing lifestyle disorders, including various hormonal disorders like hypothyroidism, PCOS, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.
    
*   It helps manage weight, enhances feelings of well-being, increases energy, promotes relaxation, improves sleep, and elevates mood.
    

3\. Types of Exercise
---------------------

There are four main types of exercises: aerobic, muscle strengthening, balance, and stretching.

*   **Aerobic Exercises:** Also known as cardiovascular or endurance training, these activities focus on heart health, making the heart more efficient. They increase heart rate and breathing. Examples include running, swimming, and cycling.
    
*   **Muscle Strengthening Exercises:** This is resistance training that improves the strength, power, and endurance of muscles. A key goal is to improve muscular endurance. Examples include push-ups and lifting weights.
    
*   **Balance Exercises:** These activities require holding a pose and maintaining equilibrium, whether stationary or moving. They focus on maintaining the body's center of gravity within its base of support. Examples include skiing (dynamic balance) and standing on one foot (static balance).
    
*   **Stretching Exercises:** These help improve flexibility and the ability of joints to move. Yoga exercises are a prime example.
    

4\. Lifestyle Disorders: A Growing Concern
------------------------------------------

Lifestyle disorders are non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or chronic diseases.

*   The prevalence of NCDs is over 21% worldwide.
    
*   Unlike communicable diseases (e.g., flu, measles) which can be cured with vaccines and antibiotics, NCDs like hypertension and diabetes cannot be cured once acquired; they can only be managed, and further complications can be prevented.
    
*   The positive aspect of NCDs is that they are preventable through healthy lifestyle practices.
    
*   NCDs are caused by a lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating, alcohol and substance abuse disorders, and smoking, which can lead to conditions like heart disease, stroke, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and lung cancer.
    
*   Exercise helps in preventing these non-communicable diseases.
    

5\. Impact of Exercise on Obesity
---------------------------------

Exercise and physical activity not only help reduce fat mass but also offer numerous physiological and psychological benefits.

*   Fitness is linked to desirable clinical outcomes, including:
    
    *   Decreasing metabolic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
        
    *   Improving various hormonal imbalances.
        
    *   Improving cardiovascular health by enhancing lipid profiles.
        
    *   Reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
        
    *   Decreasing chronic inflammation and preventing many other diseases.
        
*   Overall, exercise improves the quality of one's lifespan.
    

6\. Impact of Exercise on Type 2 Diabetes
-----------------------------------------

Exercise has been strongly associated with a 58% reduction in type 2 diabetes among high-risk populations. Its benefits stem from both acute and chronic effects on insulin activity.

*   **Acute Effect:**
    
    *   Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, meaning cells become more responsive to insulin.
        
    *   In type 2 diabetes, cells develop insulin resistance, leading to high blood sugar levels.
        
    *   By improving insulin sensitivity, exercise enables cells to utilize blood glucose more effectively, thereby reducing blood glucose levels.
        
*   **Chronic Effect:**
    
    *   Exercise enhances skeletal muscle mass.
        
    *   Muscle cells have a high number of insulin receptors.
        
    *   Increased muscle mass means more insulin receptors, allowing more blood glucose to enter cells, which further helps lower blood glucose levels.
        
*   Through these acute and chronic mechanisms, exercise significantly helps improve type 2 diabetes.
    

7\. Impact of Exercise on Cardiovascular Diseases
-------------------------------------------------

Exercise has a very positive overall effect on cardiovascular health.

*   It improves the functioning of the heart.
    
*   **Improves Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** Endurance or cardio training helps decrease the resting heart rate over time. A lower RHR indicates a more efficient heart, as it needs fewer beats to deliver the same amount of oxygen and blood to tissues.
    
*   **Improves Cholesterol Levels:** Exercise helps decrease LDL (bad cholesterol) and increase HDL (good cholesterol) levels.
    

8\. Impact of Exercise on Aging
-------------------------------

While aging is inevitable, exercise can help manage or reduce many of the complications associated with it.

*   **Combating Sarcopenia:** Sarcopenia is the age-related reduction in skeletal muscle mass and its functional ability. This leads to decreased strength. Research suggests that exercise interventions, combining aerobic and resistance training, produce therapeutic effects in the aging population by reducing sarcopenia. Ensuring adequate protein intake further supports this.
    

9\. Impact of Exercise on the Brain
-----------------------------------

Physical activity has a positive effect on mental health and cognitive abilities, especially in adolescents.

*   **Mood Enhancement:** Exercise can elevate mood by stimulating the release of "feel-good hormones" like dopamine and other endorphins, making individuals feel better after a workout.
    
*   **Research Limitations:** While research generally points to a positive impact, there isn't yet uniform data on the specific type, intensity, or frequency of exercise that consistently leads to specific brain health outcomes. The variability in exercise programs and methods of evaluating mental health across studies contribute to these limitations. However, despite these limitations, the positive impact of exercise on mental well-being is recognized.
    

10\. Unit Summary and Key Takeaways
-----------------------------------

*   Exercise is crucial for maintaining a good quality of life.
    
*   A proper combination of nutrition and exercise can help manage obesity, which in turn prevents related disorders like arthritis and cardiovascular comorbidities.
    
*   Type 2 diabetes, primarily a lifestyle issue, can be controlled by introducing a proper and sustainable exercise regimen.
    
*   Physical activity benefits the elderly by helping them maintain functional capabilities and retain muscle mass.
    
*   Despite limited extensive data in some areas, physical activity is recognized for its positive impact on brain health.
