Proteins
========

This unit delves into proteins, a crucial macronutrient, covering their definition, composition, functions, dietary sources, requirements across different populations, and methods for assessing protein quality.

1\. What are Proteins?
----------------------

Proteins are considered the most important macronutrients because the human body is primarily made up of proteins. They are the structural components of our body, forming muscles and hormones. Proteins are composed of smaller molecules called

**amino acids**. When proteins break down, they yield amino acids, and when amino acids combine, they form proteins.

2\. Functions of Proteins
-------------------------

Proteins perform numerous vital functions in the body:

*   **Building Blocks:** They are the fundamental building blocks of our body.
    
*   **Immune System:** Proteins form antibodies and immunoglobulins, which are the body's defense system against infections.
    

*   **Nourishment and Renewal:** They are vital for the nourishment, renewal, and continuity of life.
    
*   **Transport and Storage:** Proteins help in the transport and storage of various macro and micronutrients in the body.
    
*   **Enzymatic Action and Hormones:** Many enzymes and most hormones are protein-based.
    
*   **Energy Source:** Like carbohydrates, proteins provide approximately 4 calories per gram.
    

3\. Amino Acids
---------------

There are 20 different amino acids that make up proteins. They are categorized as essential or non-essential:

*   **Essential Amino Acids (9 types):** Cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through dietary intake.
    
*   **Non-Essential Amino Acids:** Can be produced by the body itself.
    

4\. Protein Requirements
------------------------

Protein requirements vary significantly based on different physiological states and activity levels:

*   **Growing Age (Children, Adolescents):** Require higher protein intake to support growth.
    
*   **Pregnant Women:** Need higher protein intake to support both their own body's needs and fetal growth.
    
*   **Lactating Women:** Require large amounts of protein for producing good quality breast milk, as milk is proteinaceous in nature.
    
*   **Athletes / Strength Training Individuals:** Need higher protein intake for muscle recovery and to compensate for muscle breakdown during intense training. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends 1.2 to 2 grams of protein per kg of body weight per day for athletes, depending on training intensity.
    
*   **General Health:** Typically requires 0.6 to 1.2 grams of protein per kg of body weight per day. For example, a 50 kg person might need up to 60 grams of protein daily.
    

5\. Dietary Sources of Protein
------------------------------

Protein can be obtained from both animal and plant-based sources:

*   **Non-Vegetarian Sources:** Eggs, chicken, fish, and meat.
    
*   **Vegetarian Sources:** Milk and milk products (dairy), beans, whole grains, nuts, soy and soy products, cheese, and paneer.
    

6\. Protein Quality and Assessment
----------------------------------

The quality of protein sources matters, especially for meeting essential amino acid needs.

### a. Complete vs. Incomplete Proteins

*   **Complete Proteins:** Provide all nine essential amino acids in adequate amounts.
    
*   **Incomplete Proteins:** Are deficient in one or more essential amino acids.
    
    *   **Sources:** Most plant-based foods like lentils, beans, nuts, and grains.
        
    *   **Complementary Proteins:** Combining different incomplete protein sources (e.g., rice and beans) within the same day can provide all essential amino acids.
        

### b. Measuring Protein Quality

Several methods assess protein quality:

*   **Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS):** A newer method that aims to improve on PDCAAS by focusing on individual indispensable (essential) amino acids digested at the end of the small intestine.
    

7\. Importance of Protein in Indian Diets (Recap)
-------------------------------------------------

The typical Indian diet is often deficient in protein. Many Indians consume less than the recommended 0.8 grams per kg of body weight.

*   **Vegetarianism:** A large portion of the Indian population is vegetarian, making it challenging to meet protein requirements, as common vegetarian sources like dals (lentils) provide lower quality protein.
    
*   **Regional Disparities:** North India often has less than half of the recommended protein intake, while Central India, despite consuming the most protein among regions, still falls short of recommendations.
    
*   **Diet Planning Implication:** Due to this widespread deficiency, protein intake is often prioritized when planning diets for the Indian population.
