Evolution of Nutrition Science","text":"<p>Nutrition science has evolved significantly over time:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Early Discoveries (1910-1950): The first vitamin (B1 or Thiamine) was discovered in 1926, and vitamin C was isolated in 1932, leading to the prevention of diseases like scurvy. The understanding of how nutrient deficiencies (e.g., in unprocessed rice husks preventing \"very-very\" disease in chickens) could lead to health issues spurred further research.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fortification and RDAs: Governments and agencies began fortifying foods with essential nutrients to combat widespread deficiencies, which helped to tackle diseases like \"very-very\". The first Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals were introduced in 1947.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on Lifestyle Diseases (1950-1990): Research shifted towards the impact of dietary sugars and fats on cardiovascular diseases. Protein deficiency diseases like marasmus and kwashiorkor in infants and children were identified, leading to the development of protein-enriched formulas and complementary foods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modernization and Chronic Diseases (1970-1990): Economic development and advancements in agriculture and food processing helped reduce single nutrient deficiencies. Dietary interventions and supplementations became more targeted for chronic lifestyle diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancers. Dietary guidelines in the 1980s emphasized avoiding excessive fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar, and sodium to prevent conditions like hypertension.</p> </li> <li> <p>Goal-Based Diet Patterns and Gut Microbiome (1990-Present): Current nutrition science focuses on personalized, goal-based dietary patterns, addressing individual health goals like weight loss, muscle gain, or disease reversal.
