Evolution of Nutrition Science","text":"<p>Nutrition science has evolved significantly over time:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Early Discoveries (1910-1950): The first vitamin (B1 or Thiamine) was discovered in 1926, and vitamin C was isolated in 1932, leading to the prevention of diseases like scurvy. The understanding of how nutrient deficiencies (e.g., in unprocessed rice husks preventing \"very-very\" disease in chickens) could lead to health issues spurred further research.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fortification and RDAs: Governments and agencies began fortifying foods with essential nutrients to combat widespread deficiencies, which helped to tackle diseases like \"very-very\". The first Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals were introduced in 1947.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on Lifestyle Diseases (1950-1990): Research shifted towards the impact of dietary sugars and fats on cardiovascular diseases. Protein deficiency diseases like marasmus and kwashiorkor in infants and children were identified, leading to the development of protein-enriched formulas and complementary foods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modernization and Chronic Diseases (1970-1990): Economic development and advancements in agriculture and food processing helped reduce single nutrient deficiencies. Dietary interventions and supplementations became more targeted for chronic lifestyle diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancers. Dietary guidelines in the 1980s emphasized avoiding excessive fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar, and sodium to prevent conditions like hypertension.</p> </li> <li> <p>Goal-Based Diet Patterns and Gut Microbiome (1990-Present): Current nutrition science focuses on personalized, goal-based dietary patterns, addressing individual health goals like weight loss, muscle gain, or disease reversal.

The Diet Priority Pyramid","text":"<p>This pyramid outlines the most crucial factors in designing an effective dietary plan, prioritizing what truly matters for health and fitness:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Energy Balance (Calories In vs. Calories Out): This is the foundation and most important factor. The total amount of calories consumed in a day dictates how the body responds, regardless of the specific diet strategy (e.g., keto, low-carb, high-carb).</p> </li> <li> <p>Macronutrients (Protein, Carbs, Fats): The ratio of these nutrients is the second most important aspect. For Indian diets, prioritizing protein intake (often deficient) is crucial, followed by adjusting carbs and fats.</p> </li> <li> <p>Micronutrients (Vitamins &amp; Minerals): Incorporating a variety of vegetables and fruits is essential to meet micronutrient needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nutrition Timing: Less relevant than the above. Whether one eats after 6 PM or practices intermittent fasting has minimal impact on overall calorie intake, as 100 calories remain 100 calories regardless of timing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Supplements: The least important factor. Supplements like whey protein or fat burners are generally not necessary for weight loss or overall health unless specific deficiencies exist (e.g., a need for multivitamins).

Common protein sources for them include limited milk, dal (lentils), or paneer (Indian cheese) only once or twice a week.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quality of Protein: Protein from pulses, a common source in India, is not considered high-quality protein.
