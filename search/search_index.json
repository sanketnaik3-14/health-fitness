This definition emphasizes a holistic view of health, encompassing:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Physical Health: Involves the proper functioning of your body, from external appearance to internal systems like circulation and digestion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mental Health: Refers to your psychological well-being, including emotional stability, clear thinking, and the ability to manage stress. A person free from physical disease but dealing with mood disorders or psychological strain is not considered truly healthy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Social Health: How you interact and behave towards people around you, including maintaining healthy relationships.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spiritual Health: While not religious, it refers to having a mindful and peaceful approach to life, with clear understanding and organization in daily activities, free from external disturbances that affect mental well-being.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Nutrition: This is the scientific study of nutrients and other substances found in food.

Evolution of Nutrition Science","text":"<p>Nutrition science has evolved significantly over time:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Early Discoveries (1910-1950): The first vitamin (B1 or Thiamine) was discovered in 1926, and vitamin C was isolated in 1932, leading to the prevention of diseases like scurvy. The understanding of how nutrient deficiencies (e.g., in unprocessed rice husks preventing \"very-very\" disease in chickens) could lead to health issues spurred further research.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fortification and RDAs: Governments and agencies began fortifying foods with essential nutrients to combat widespread deficiencies, which helped to tackle diseases like \"very-very\". The first Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals were introduced in 1947.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on Lifestyle Diseases (1950-1990): Research shifted towards the impact of dietary sugars and fats on cardiovascular diseases. Protein deficiency diseases like marasmus and kwashiorkor in infants and children were identified, leading to the development of protein-enriched formulas and complementary foods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modernization and Chronic Diseases (1970-1990): Economic development and advancements in agriculture and food processing helped reduce single nutrient deficiencies. Dietary interventions and supplementations became more targeted for chronic lifestyle diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancers. Dietary guidelines in the 1980s emphasized avoiding excessive fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sugar, and sodium to prevent conditions like hypertension.</p> </li> <li> <p>Goal-Based Diet Patterns and Gut Microbiome (1990-Present): Current nutrition science focuses on personalized, goal-based dietary patterns, addressing individual health goals like weight loss, muscle gain, or disease reversal. There's significant research into dietary complexities and the role of the gut microbiome in digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall health, recognizing individual sensitivities and intolerances.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"chapter-1/#5-malnutrition-and-optimal-nutrition","title":"5. Malnutrition and Optimal Nutrition","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Malnutrition: Can manifest as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Undernutrition: Often seen in poverty-stricken areas due to lack of adequate income and food affordability. Governments implement programs to provide free supplements and good nutrition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Micronutrient Deficiencies: Result from imbalanced diets, sedentary lifestyles, and poor eating habits (e.g., excessive alcohol). These can be addressed with structured dietary interventions and healthy eating patterns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Obesity: A global problem leading to various lifestyle diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular issues. Proper dietary interventions and lifestyle changes are crucial for tackling obesity.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Optimal Nutrition: Refers to consuming the right quantities of macronutrients, micronutrients, and water to achieve good physical performance, strength, and overall quality of life. Regular blood tests can help identify suboptimal or deficient nutrient levels, which can then be corrected through diet or, in specific cases like older adults with reduced digestion, through physician-advised supplements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balanced Diet/Meal: Each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) should ideally include a balanced serving of protein, fat, carbohydrates, and sufficient quantities of fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are considered \"protective foods\" as they provide micronutrients, fiber, and antioxidants, aiding in fighting infections and promoting overall health.

They provide therapeutic diets, often prescribed by physicians, to help patients regain nutritional well-being.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nutritionists (Nutrition Consultants): They provide general information about food and diet and suggest healthy dieting practices, including macronutrient intake, water consumption, and sleep requirements. While they can advise, for extreme medical conditions, they must work in conjunction with dietitians or physicians. The title \"nutritionist\" is not legally protected in many places (like India), meaning anyone can pursue courses in this field, but they must ensure their education is recognized and that they do not provide advice that could harm people due to a lack of knowledge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nutritional Therapists: Similar to nutritionists, they make diet recommendations to prevent or improve illness, often based on holistic approaches or personal opinions. Their title is also not legally protected. They might use specific foods to aid recovery from illness or medical treatments, such as prescribing iron-rich foods after surgery to help with blood loss.

High LDL can lead to the formation of plaque in arteries, a condition called atherosclerosis, restricting blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases.</p> </li> <li> <p>High Blood Sugars: Directly linked to insulin resistance and diabetes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure): An increase in pressure exerted by blood on the artery walls.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Normal BP: 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hypertension (Stage 1): \u2265140/90 mmHg.</p> </li> <li> <p>Severe Hypertension (Stage 2): \u2265180/120 mmHg.</p> </li> <li> <p>In 2015, WHO reported that one out of four men and one out of five women suffer from hypertension.</p> </li> <li> <p>Symptoms: Irregular heartbeats, nosebleeds, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and buzzing in the ears.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS/PCOS): Primarily affects women due to hormonal imbalances, specifically high levels of androgens (male hormones) produced by the ovaries.
